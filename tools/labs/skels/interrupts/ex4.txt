get_char function to get the character form the buffer and update cound and get_idx fields
read: read data from buffer using get_char function until size is 0 and increment reads,
used splinlock from irq
I test it like this:
 mknod /dev/kbd c 42 0
i load the module
cat /dev/kbd
but it's empty
something must be wrong :))
